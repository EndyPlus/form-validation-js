## Interactive Form with Validation ðŸ“ƒ

### Objective:

Create an HTML registration form with fields for name, email, password, and phone number. Implement client-side validation using JavaScript and server-side validation using Node.js with Express. ðŸŽ¯

### Detailed Description ðŸ”Ž:

- _The form includes fields: name (min 2 characters), email (valid format), password (min 8 characters, with letters and numbers), and phone number (e.g., +380 format)._
- _Client-side validation uses JavaScript to check input formats and display real-time error messages._
- _Server-side validation uses Node.js/Express to re-validate inputs and return success or error responses._
- _The form is styled with Tailwind CSS for a clean, responsive design._
- _On successful submission, the server stores the data in memory (for simplicity) and returns a confirmation._
